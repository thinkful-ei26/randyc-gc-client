## GoodCall

In the dark and distant past when landlines were the norm, the appropriate time to call someone seemed more apparent but with the advent of mobile phones and more diverse work schedules that 'good' time to call a person has become harder to discern. Combine that with the alluring and intoxicating ability to call other time zones and the problem both escalates and becomes more complex. All this amazing technology but still that paralyzing question, when is a good time to call? Enter the 'goodCall' app, providing a simple way to have a 'friends and family' group communicate their individual call time schedules to each other and help match up times when it is best for both parties to talk based on a comparison of individual schedules. Hopefully the simple knowledge of knowing when a person is available to talk will result in more robust communication amongst groups. 

GoodCall is intended to help a user keep track of the good times to call people.
